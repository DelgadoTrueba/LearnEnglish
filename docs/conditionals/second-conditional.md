# Second Conditional

(Unreal Present): are used to express imaginary situations which are contrary facts in the present, therefore, are unlikely to happen in the present or future.

Aqui hacemos una hipótesis sobre el presente o futuro muy poco probable.  
Estamos creando un presente/futuro alternativo que no corresponde con la realidad y lo que hariamos si fuese verdad.
